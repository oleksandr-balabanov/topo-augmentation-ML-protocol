# topo-augmentation-ML-protocol

Contains code for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03469">https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03469</a>

1. Produce datasets of topologically equivalent samples using topological data augmunation.

2. Train a neural network classifier for extracting the topological indices. The training is done within TensorFlow (Keras).

Oleksandr Balabanov and Mats Granath

## Prerequisites

Python 3

## Installation

The required libraries are matplotlib, numpy, jupyter, and tensorflow (tensorflow-gpu).

## The code

For ease of use the code is saved in format of jupter notebooks. There are two folders correspoding to two in our article: topological systems in 1d class AIII and 2d class A. Each folder contains seperate files for creating the datasets and for training the neural network classifiers.
